This is not meant to be a regular image editor.

This is not fully complete but it will work with images of a certain size. It can easily be edited to fix this.

It requires Openframeworks. for windows Just put the project in apps/myapps/ for mac and linux you will have to generate a project.

There is a color editor and load and save buttons.
